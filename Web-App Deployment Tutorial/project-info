Let us simulate myself (Sunny) as the projeect manager. We have two resources for this project. Tom is the fornt-end guy whose expertise lies in HTML & CSS. While we have Jerry who is the back-end guy whose expertise lies in JaveScript.
We will be creating two branches for each of them to code adn then collaborate and merge and I will act as the project manager and accept merging and finally hosting the web app using GitHub.
